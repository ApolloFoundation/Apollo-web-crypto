# Tests (with Jest)

In the `src` folder, we have folder called `__tests__`.
Add a new file with a name you like, but it has to end with `test.ts`, for example `FBCrypto.test.ts`

Run tests:
<pre>
yarn test
</pre>

# Bumping a new npm package version

Letâ€™s bump a new patch version of the package:
<pre>
npm version patch
</pre>
Our `preversion`, `version`, and `postversion` will run, create a new tag in git and push it to our remote repository. Now publish:
<pre>
npm publish --access=public
</pre>
And now you have a new version.
